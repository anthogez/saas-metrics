This Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for a SaaS metrics benchmarking platform. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, project managers, stakeholders, and quality assurance teams involved in the development and deployment of the platform.

## 1.2 Scope

The SaaS metrics benchmarking platform is a web-based application designed to provide comparative analytics across different revenue ranges and data sources. The system will:

- Present benchmark data for 14 key SaaS performance metrics
- Enable data filtering by Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) ranges and sources
- Display statistical distributions (5th to 90th percentiles) for each metric
- Provide a public-facing interface for data consumption
- Include an administrative backend for data management and maintenance
- Support secure authentication and role-based access control
- Enable data export functionality
- Facilitate bulk data import capabilities
- Maintain audit logs for data modifications

The platform will be developed as a web application compatible with the Replit developer environment, focusing on delivering accurate, real-time benchmark data to help SaaS companies evaluate their performance against industry standards.
